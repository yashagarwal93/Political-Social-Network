# Political-Social-Network

•	The goal was to use the Twitter API to construct a social network of 4 U.S. presidential candidates
•	Analyzed the number of shared accounts followed by each pair of candidates
•	Created a networkx undirected Graph, added each candidate and friend as a node (only if they are followed by more than one candidate)
•	Technologies Used: Python, Collections, matplotlib, networkx, TwitterAPI.
